# Instances
In this repository, problem instances for various optimization problems can be found
Repository includes instances for:
1. The single-source capacitated facility location problem. In the .zip file DualAscentInstances we have included the 30 instances used in "Integrating cut-and-solve and semi-Lagrangean based dual ascent for the single source capacitated facility location problem" (Chapter 3 of the PhD thesis: "Discrete Facility - Theory, Algorithms and extensions to multiple objectives"). The .zip file AnImprovedCutAndsolveAlgorithm includes the 45 instances used in "An improved cut--and--solve algorithm for the single--source capacitated facility location problem" (Chapter 2 of the PhD thesis: "Discrete Facility - Theory, Algorithms and extensions to multiple objectives").
